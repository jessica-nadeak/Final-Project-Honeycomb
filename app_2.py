        Porter is a tech-enabled logistics company offering a variety of intracity 
        and intercity delivery services. From a pin to an entire house, Porter will 
        deliver anything, anywhere, anytime. However, Porter does not deliver item(s) 
        which are illegal, dangerous or hazardous in nature or which are prohibited by 
        any statue or law.

        This app is made, as a Final Project from Digital Skola, by Team Honeycomb. 
        This app will do Delivery Time Estimation on Porter delivery services. 
        The whole process upon making this app started from thorough data preprocessing, 
        model selection & training, model evaluation until model tuning. We believe the 
        prediction the app generates is accurate as we made it from the best of our knowledge.
